# Simple Android App 6

## Problem  – Airline Reservation System

### A very small airline has asked you to develop a new system. You’re to write an app to assign seats on each flight of the airline’s only plane (capacity: 10 seats).

### This application will only run on one device, yours. So, don’t worry about database and/or multiple users accessing a central server. 

### A user can select First class or Economy. Seats are randomly assigned. 

### First Class is from seats 1 to 5 while Economy is from 6 to 10. Your app should never assign a seat that has already been assigned.  If there are no more seats available, inform the user.

### Example output (You can re-design to make it look better)
